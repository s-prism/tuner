## What the tuner does

If you play a sound with an instrument, the tuner identifies the closest musical note to this sound. It then displays whether the sound played is a higher or lower pitch than the musical note, and how much the player is out of tune by (measured in cents). The user can customise the tuning system used (i.e. the pitch of the A4 musical note)
